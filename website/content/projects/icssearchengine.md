The __UCI ICS Search Engine__ is a search engine that I built for my CS 121 (Information retrieval) class at UCI. It acts as a search engine on the ICS subdomain of UCI website. It uses techniques such as PageRank, tf-idf scoring, and mapreduce in order to deliver accurate results. I also used json indexing on pages so that these results would be able to be retrieved in significantly less time (~500ms)
