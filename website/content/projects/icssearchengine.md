The __UCI ICS Search Engine__ is a search engine that I built for my CS 121 (Information retrieval) class at UCI. It acts as a search engine on the ICS subdomain of UCI website. It uses techniques such as PageRank, tf-idf scoring, and mapreduce in order to deliver accurate results. I also built a small full stack website to host the engine, using flask as an APi endpoint for the search engine whilst using next.js for the user interface.
