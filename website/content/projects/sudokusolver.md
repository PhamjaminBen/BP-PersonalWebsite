__Sudoku Solver__ is an efficient sudoku solver that I implemented for my CS171 (AI introduction) class at UCI. It uses many search hueristics, such as Minimum Remaining Values, Norvig Check, and Least Constraining value to find the answer to any size sudoku puzzle with minimal backtracks and trail pushes.
