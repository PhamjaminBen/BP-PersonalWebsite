__BballBot__ is a discord bot developed with discord.py that delivers NBA statistics about players and teams to discord servers. It uses SQLite to store player data that can be quickly accessed by the discord bot. I used the beautifulsoup library in order to web scrape multiple NBA statistics pages in order to provide update info.
